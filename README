This is an install script for deb-based GNU/Linux systems. It uses the OpenFWWF firmware to get the b43 card functioning.

Deb packages are downloaded from the trisquel repositories.

If you are using this script to install the firmware for the b4331 chipset (2011 Macbooks, and other devices), the installed packages are not 100% free software, since some files are needed from Broadcom's proprietary firmware and the free firmware is not 100% functional for this card.

I have personally tested the b4331.sh script on 3.8.* linux-libre, but it should work on older kernels.
